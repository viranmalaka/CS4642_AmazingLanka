Padamagaraya I
To the west to the Abhayagirya monastery on the outer circular road (Watawanda Road) are two Padanagara structures.
Padanagara Complexes were used by the meditating monks and are located away from the cities and human settlements. Padanagara are built on a unique architectural style with a moat surrounding them. Quite often these structures were built as twin structures on a rocky outcrop surrounded by the moat. Sometimes there are waterways even inside the moat underneath the buildings such as this building complex.
The buildings made of granite pillars void of any decorations. The only carvings you find on such buildings are on the urinal stones
Traveling along Watawandana Road from Kuttam Pokuna for 4 kilometers passing Abhayagiriya Stupa, you will reach this site on the left to the road. 3 entrances made of granite slabs and pillars of this structure can be seen today. 4 separate structures, all isolated by waterways would have provided the meditating bikkus with all the serenity they needed in the ancient past.
There is not a single caving on any of the rocks. To the right to the building outside the main structure is where the outhouse was located. Here you will see the only caved rock in the whole building, the urinal stone.
Travelling a further 1.5 km from this site, you will come across the Padanagara building II of the Anuradhapura Kingdom.
The map above also shows other places of interest within a approximately 20 km radius of the current site. Click on any of the markers and the info box to take you to information of these sites.
