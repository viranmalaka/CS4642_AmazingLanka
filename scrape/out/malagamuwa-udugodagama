Malagamuwa Udugodagama Ancient Viharaya is a Buddhist temple with an ancient Tampita Viharaya built during the Kandyan Kingdom.  The temple lies 20 km off Kurunegala off Kurunegala – Hiripitiya road. To reach the temple take the Hiripitiya road (B300) from Kurunegala and travel 18 km to reach the Malagamuwa Junction. Take the left turn towards Udugodagama and travel 2 km to reach the temple. The distance to the temple from Wariyapola is 16 km.
A Tampita Viharaya is a structure built on a wooden platform which rests on number of stone stumps usually 3-4 feet tall. The roof is held by a structure built of timber and the walls are generally made of wattle and daub.
The Tampita Viharaya at the Malagamuwa Udugodagama Purana Viharaya is comparatively small. A narrow circumambulating path with no protective rail surrounds the image house. The entrance and the outer wall of the image house is painted orange and its unclear if there were any murals on the walls.
A Samadhi statue belonging to the Kandyan era underneath a Dragon Arch lies at the center of the image house. 2 standing Buddha statues lie beside the main image facing each other. Statues of 2 deities stand beside the standing Buddha statues. The rest of the walls are covered in murals.
