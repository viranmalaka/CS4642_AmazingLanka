The Nakha Vehera belongs to the late late Anuradhapura era ( 7-10th centuries) and belongs to the Mahayana tradition like all other square stupas. The base is about 9×9 meters and ruins of an image house and some other buildings has been discovered in the close vicinity of this stupa.
The stupa lies 200 meters away from the Watawandara Road and a gravel road from the sign board can be barely seen. Once you take this turn, the road amost disappears due to disuse and 1-2 feet tall shrubs has taken over the road clearing. During rainy season the path becomes so muddy, only a 4 wheel drive will be able to make up to the stupa.
