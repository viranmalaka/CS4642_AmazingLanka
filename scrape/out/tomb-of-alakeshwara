Believed to be the place of burial of the founder of Kotte, the Tomb of Alakeshwara can be easily reached through the Alakeshwara road on the Pittakotte road. Alakeshwara who was a minister of King Vikramabahu III of Gampola was entrusted to cease the advance of Arya Chakravarti’s armies which were advancing along the western coast. According to local legend, the minister observed a hare being chased by a jackal and when it came to a particular region the hare started chasing the jackal in return. Therefore the region was recognized as a Jaya Bumi and considered suitable to build a fortress.
It is from this position that the Minister Alakeshwara commandeered his campaign against the northern army and repulsed their advance. Later kings chose this region as their capital due to the natural protection it offered through the extensive marshes and the Diyawanna Oya.
