Sri Lanka, in comparison to its size, has perhaps the largest number of waterfalls of any country in the world. Indeed, there are over 480 recorded waterfalls in Sri Lanka. LCWF was the first organization to put an consolidated effort to develop an complete list of waterfalls of Sri Lanka. They created an database of 382 waterfalls in the country.
This list based on the LCWF database but has been expanded by further 81 waterfalls making the total 483 waterfalls. More information has been added to each waterfall and most has been accurately mapped on Google Maps. Some of the mistakes made on original database has been also corrected. In addition to the above 17 unnamed waterfalls too have been marked with links to photos on the google maps.
This work is not over yet and many more waterfalls known only to local communities are yet to be listed. If you like to provide additional information on any waterfall please contact the site owner.
