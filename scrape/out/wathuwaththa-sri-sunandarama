The balance 8 pillars are made of stone. According to folklore this temple has been built by king Keerthi Sri Rajasinhe (1747 – 1781) as a wish granted to a villager of the Wathuwatta village. A wooden stair case is built to reach the wooden platform of the Tampita Viharaya. A narrow circumambulating path is built around the image house with a wider space at the front.  A Hewisi Mandapaya has been built in front of the Tampita Viharaya and both roofs are thatched with flat clay tiles typical of buildings of Kandyan era.
