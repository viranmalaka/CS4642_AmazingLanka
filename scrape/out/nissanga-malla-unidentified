Unidentified structure at the Nissanga Malla’s court
This building and the next two structures of King Nissanga Malla (1187-1196)  has to be reached passing the Pollonnaruwa rest house at the end of the dam or passing the new museum by foot. You also find the Nissanga Malla’s Palace and the Court in this area.
This is a lonely multi storied building made out of bricks. The staircase is still intact. An important feature of this building is that it has no windows. Due to this feature it is also thought to be a tomb of King Nissanka Malla. The original plaster is still intact giving a glimpse of what the plastering of buildings looked like over 800 years ago.
