Galpotha
Gal Potha (Stone Book) is one of the famous works of King Nissanka Malla (1187-1196) which describes himself, his rule and the eligibility for being a king of Sri Lanka. This massive slab which is 26’10” feet (8.2 meters) long and 4’7” feet (1.4 meters) in breath has been brought form Mahiyangana area by the worriers of King Nissanka Malla (1187-1196). The text is written in 3 columns and contain over 4300 characters in 72 lines.
There are signs that liquidized metal has been pored on to the carved characters to bring out the letters much clearer.
