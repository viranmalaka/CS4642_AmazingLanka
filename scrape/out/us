Content:

The AmazingLanka.com site is developed & maintained by a single individual with a passion for the beauty and the heritage of Sri Lanka. The purpose of the website is to educate Sri Lankans as well as visitors about this small island with a vibrant 2500 year civilization which only few countries in the world can claim. Therefore I have attempted to provide maximum details of each site, place or town.
