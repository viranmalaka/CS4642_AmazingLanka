This Vishnu Kovil  is situated on the right side of the inner city entrance of the Ancient Capital of Polonnaruwa. This kovil has been completely built with granite blocks but only the bottom portion of the building survives today. On the left of the entrance, two more 
 can be seen. Out of these three,  this Vishnu Kovil has survived the forces of nature better than the other two.
