A Tampita Viharaya is a structure built on a wooden platform which rests on number of stone stumps usually 3-4 feet tall. The roof is held by a structure built of timber and the walls are generally made of wattle and daub.
Talammehera Sri Sunandarama Tampita Viharaya is built on 10 granite pillar stumps. A narrow circumambulating path built around the inner chamber with more space at the front to create a porch. The image house lacks any murals. This structure was declared as a protected archaeology site by the gazette dated 24th July 2009 and has been restored by the department of archaeology recently.
