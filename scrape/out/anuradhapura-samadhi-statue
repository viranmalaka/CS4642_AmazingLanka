Samadhi Statue is considered one of the best sculptures in the Anuradhapura era. It is thought to be done during the 3rd or the 4th century. It is made out of dolomite marble and stands 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 metres) in height. This statue was found in the present location in 1886 fallen to the ground with damages to the nose. It was then erected and the nose was reconstructed. In 1914, it was found damaged by treasure hunters and re constructed again.
The statue’s eyes are hollow indicating they were impressed with crystal or precious stones. It is unclear whether this and the 2nd statue were brought from another vihara or they were originally kept here.
It is said that when you look at the face of the statue from three sides they show 3 different features. Looking at the profile of the face from left and right they show a slight sadness and a slightly smiling face on the other. Looking from the front, the face shows neutral features.
Today this stature is covered by concrete structure which has somewhat destroyed the beauty of this statue. Even the reconstruction of the nose has not been a success which looks very artificial.
Next to the Samadhi statue is an ruins of an image house which is called Bodhisattva Image House. According to Maha Vamsa, the great chronicle of Sri Lanka, it is said that the King Dhatusena (459-477) has built an  image house for the Maithree Bodhisattva left to the Abhayagiriya Bodhi Tree Shrine and had decorated with royal garments. It is believed these remains are the image house built by king Dhatusena. An limestone Bodhisattva image has been found buried in the rubble which has been dated to the 5th century.
