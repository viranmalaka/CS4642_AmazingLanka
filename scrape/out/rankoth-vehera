Rankoth ( Rankot) Vehera (Goldern Pinnacle) Stupa, is the 4th largest stupa in the country after 
, 
 and 
 in Anuradhapura. Built by King Nissanka Malla (1187-1196), it is 55 meters in height 185 meters in circumference. This is the largest Stupa in Polonnaruwa.
Initial name of this has been “Ruwanmali dagaba” and this is a probably an attempt to build a similar Stupa to the 
 of Anuradhapura. A rock inscription east to the Stupa describes how the King Nissanka Malla (1187-1196) supervised to the work of this temple sitting at that place.
The guard stones at the menik vehera is also unique. Generally on the side of the guard stone you can find a carving of a bull. But on the guard stones at the entrance of the Menik vehera this bull has been replaced by an elephant.
