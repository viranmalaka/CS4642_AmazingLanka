To the west to the Abhayagirya monastery on the outer circular road (Watawanda Road) are two Padanagara structures.
Padanagara Complexes were used by the meditating monks and are located away from the cities and human settlements. Padanagara are built on a unique architectural style with a moat surrounding them. Quite often these structures were
built as twin structures on a rocky outcrop surrounded by the moat. Sometimes there are waterways even inside the moat underneath the buildings such as this building complex.
The buildings made of granite pillars void of any decorations. The only carvings you find on such buildings are on the urinal stones
Traveling along Watawandana Road from Kuttam Pokuna for 5.5 kilometers passing Abhayagiriya Stupa and 1.5 km passing the 
, you will reach this site on the left to the road.
This is smaller than the first but it has been restored to a more greater extend with granite walls with perfect fit rising to about 5 feet.
There is not a single caving on any of the buildings. To the right to the building outside the main structure is where the outhouse was located. Here you will see the only caved rock in the whole building, the urinal stone.
