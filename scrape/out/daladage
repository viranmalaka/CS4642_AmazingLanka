To the north east of 
, lies a set of ruins which are rarely visited by pilgrims. These ruins are accessible through a by-road on the Watawandana Road or Sangamitta Road.
The ruins lying in this area are the  
 (one of the refectories of 
), A ruin identified as the
 (House of the Tooth Relic), 
, an image house with a semi domical roof) and another image house almost identical to Gedige, simply known as Building “A”. All these 4 buildings lie 50 meters of each other.
The ruins of the building known as Daladage is believed to be the Temple of Tooth built after the defeat of Colas by king Mahinda IV (956-972 AC) who was the last great builder in the Anuradhapura era.
The identification of the Tooth Relic Temple or Daladage in Anuradhapura was subject to much debate. Today, a building close to the Mahapali Alms Hall has been identified as the Daladage. An inscription found near a circular pond has aided in the identification of the site. Scholars identified the inscription to belong to the reign of King Mahinda IV.
But the interpretation of the slab inscription which identified the Daladage built by King Mahinda IV has been questioned and if this building is the Daladage or if this is the entrance to the palace of Mahinda IV and whether the tooth relic has been worshipped at the nearby Gedige or the other shrine room close by is being raised.
The remains of the Temple of Tooth Relic or the Daladage stand within a quadrangular enclosure, 200×214 feet. The monument inside consists a large edifice with wide bays on 3 of the 4 sides and 2 smaller subsidiary buildings on north-west and north-east out of which the one has almost disappeared. The main entrance to the quadrangular enclosure lies on the center of its northern side and the inscription which finally pinpointed the location of this Daladage as described in the ancient texts stands near this its entrance.
