Mayura Pirivena in Anuradhapura is one of the primary learning centers belonging to the Maha Viharaya Aramic Complex during the Anuradhapura era. This Pirivena has been built by king Buddhadasa (340-368) according to ancient records.
The present circuit bungalow of the Dept. of Archaeology which is in close proximity to the Mayura Pirivena is believed to be the site of the Granthakara Pirivena where Buddhaghosha Thera occupied himself with his commentaries while residing in it.
Buddhagosha thero was an Indian Theravada Buddhist commentator and scholar in the 5th century. On finding a text for which the commentary on Tripitakaya had been lost in India, Buddhaghosa traveled to Sri Lanka to study a Sinhalese commentary that was preserved in Maha Viharaya Monastery in Anuradhapura.
In Sri Lanka, Buddhaghosa began to study what was apparently a very large volume of commentarial texts that had been assembled and preserved by the monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya.
The interpretations provided by Buddhaghosa have generally constituted the orthodox understanding of Theravada scriptures since at least the 12th century. He is generally recognized by both Western scholars and Theravadins as the most important commentator of the Theravada.
Buddhaghosa himself described the Mayura Pirivena as “beautifully appointed, agreeably endowed, with cool shade and with an ample water supply”. Today only a few calved pillars remain of the Mayura Pirivena and other parts of it may still lie buried under the nearby bungalow.
