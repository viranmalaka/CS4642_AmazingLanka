Silachetiya (Kujjatissa) Stupa
The stupa called Silachetiya (Sila Chetiya) is also known as Kujjatissa Stupa since this has been associated with a bikku by the same name who is said to have had miraculous powers.
According to the information board installed by the Department of Archaeology, it is believed that this stupa has been built during the period king Saddhatissa (137 – 119 BC). The Chronicles of Mahavamsa and the Manorathapurani identifies this stupa as Sila Chethiya. According to Manorathapurani, when the bikku Kujjatissa passed away, the body has levitated and moved to the location of Sila Chetiya and performed miracles. The existing structure has architectural features of late Anuradhapura period. The maps drown in the 19
 century by Major Skinner also identifies this stupa as Sila Chetiya.
There was also a belief that this was the tomb of Elara which has lost its momentum now.
The restored stupa lies on an elevated square platform. Large granite slabs covers the platform from all four sides. Flights of steps lead to the top of the platform on all four sides. Each flight of steps carved out of granite is accompanied by a pair of elegant Guardstones and a pair of Balustrades with Makara designs.
Even though this stupa lies close to a busy road to
where pilgrims frequently travel, not much attention is given by them.
