This Shiva Kovil is considered to be one of the oldest buildings of the Polonnaruwa Kingdom to survive the ravages of time.  This Shiva kovil is thought to be built by Tamil invaders (10th century) who initially establish their capital in Polonnaruwa. This building is completely built out of stone finely laid with perfect precision. Due to this reason, this is one of the well preserved artifacts of the ancient kingdom.
