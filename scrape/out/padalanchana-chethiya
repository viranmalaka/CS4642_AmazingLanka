Padalanchana Chethiya
Fifty meters to the south east of 
 lies a small stupa identified as the Padalanchana Chethiya. This is also referred to as Sila Chethiya and Digha Stupa and has been originally built by king Lagnatissa (119-109 BC), son of king Saddhatissa covering footprint of Buddha.
According the Great Chronicle Mahavamsa, Dipavansa and Mahabothivamsa, Buddha has placed his foot print at this site rising to the air to return to India after his 3rd visit to Sri Lanka.
According to Mahavamsa this place has been one of the four places where all the Buddhas of this aeon have left his foot prints. Thus all four Kakusanndha, Konagamana, Kassapa and Gouthama Buddha has at one time come to this small island at one time and come to this place before leaving this island and left their foot prints.
The restored stupa is built on a circular platform. A flight of steps decorated with moonstones, Guardstones and balustrades takes you this platform. Sadly not much attention is given by the visitors to this stupa.
