Irrigation systems of ancient Sri Lanka consist of a large number of village reservoirs to gigantic reservoirs and a intrinsic network of water canals connecting these tanks while supplying water to farming land. There about 30,000 reservoirs in Sri Lanka of which the majority was built form 3rd century BC to 12th century. This compared to the Sri Lankan dry zone land area of about 40,000 sq. kilometres (where almost all the tanks are located), is almost equivalent to one reservoir for each sq. kilometre.
The first large reservoir to be built in recorded history is 
 in 3rd century BC. From that day onwards Sri Lankan tank builders developed a remarkable expertise on controlling large bodies of water which allowed them to built massive reservoirs which no other civilisation ever could have dreamt of.
The breakthrough which made the Sri Lankan Irrigation Engineers build such massive reservoirs was invention of the “Biso Kotuwa” of valve pit as early as 3rd century BC which could easily regulate the out flow extremely large water bodies. Europeans stared using the valve pits in their reservoirs only in the mid 18th century, 2100 years later according to H. Parker, an Irrigation Engineer who was in charge of restoring many ancient irrigation reservoirs in late 1800’s, in his book ‘Ancient Ceylon’
He goes on to say,
Another development of the ancient irrigation systems is the remarkable instrumentation precision. When king Dathusena (459-477 AD) built Yodha Ela, also known as Jayaganga, the ancient irrigation engineers first found out that the Kala Wewa in 
 was built on a slightly elevated ground compared to 
 in 
. Then he built the 54 mile ( 87 Km ) Yoda Ela with a gradient of 6-12 inches per mile ( appox 10 to 20 cm per kilometre) to carry excess water in the Kala Wewa to 
. How these engineers could achieve such precision still baffles experts today.
