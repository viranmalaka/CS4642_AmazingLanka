A sketch of a Tampita Viharaya
Wanguthanna Sri Sunandaramaya is a Buddhist temple in Watareka, Mawathagama with an ancient Tampita Viharaya built during the Kandyan Kingdom. The temple lies off Rambkkama – Mawathagama road, 12 km off Rambukkana and 10km off Mawathagama.
To reach the temple from Rambukkana take the Mawathagama road and travel about 9km passing Koshinna and Parape  and take the Watareka Road. Travel 2.2 km on this remote road until you reach Watareka Maha Vidyalaya. The road folks with a narrow road on the right few hundred feet after passing the school. Take this narrow road for 500 meters to reach the temple. Taking the road just in-front of Watareka Maha Vidyalaya will take you to another Tampita Viharaya in 
.
A Tampita Viharaya is a structure built on a wooden platform which rests on number of stone stumps usually 3-4 feet tall. The roof is held by a structure built of timber and the walls are generally made of wattle and daub.
Wanguthanna Sri Sunandaramaya has been built by king Keerthi Sri Rajasinhe (1747 – 1781) on the advice of Ven. Weliwita Saranankara Thero. The Tampita Viharaya at Sunandaramaya  is built on comparitively high granite pillars and the floor below has been used as a Pohoya Geya and the image house has been the upper floor. This Tampita viharaya has gone through some changes during later renovations eroding its archaeological value.
The temple was declared as a protected archaeological site by the gazette published on 6 June 2008.   In 2009 Treasure hunters caused severe damage to the chaitya and Buddha image of this temple. The “Dewathakotuwa” of the chaitya was damaged by hunters trying to retrieve valuable relics deposited there and the pillow where the head of the statue was placed, also suffered damage.
