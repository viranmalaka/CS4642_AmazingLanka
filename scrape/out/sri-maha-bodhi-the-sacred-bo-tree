Entrance to the Bo Tree Enclosure as in 1896 from The ruined cities of Ceylon by Henry W. Cave
After bringing Buddhism to Sri Lanka by Mahinda Thero in 250 BC Emperor Asoka in India sent his daughter Theri Sanghamitta to the island with a branch of the Sacred Bodhi obtained from the main stem of the bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya under which Buddha attained enlightenment. King Tissa received the sapling and planted it at the present site in 249 BC. Taking this information to account today (in 2013) the Sri Maha Bodhi tree is exactly 2263 years old. Thus this tree is  considered the oldest living tree in world in the recorded history.
There are special guards who look after the Bodhi Tree. This again is an age old custom continued to date by people who live in the neighbourhood whose ancestors have received the land for their services. This may be probably one of the oldest surviving religious professions in the world.
The bodhi tree was subjected to a vandalised act by a madman who tried to cut off the tree in 1929. He did manage to cut off a branch of the tree. Then again in 1985 this holy ground faced a ruthless attack by the Tamil terrorists (LTTE) who stormed in to premises brutally gunning down 229 innocent civilians including 17monks, 21 nuns, 52 children, 41 women and 98 men while 385 got wounded.
Today you can see this 2260+ year old tree which is helped by few metal towers and accompanied by 41 “parivara” (companion) trees.
