This Stone Pavilion (Burrows Pavilion)  is thought to be the entrance to the oldest Bodhighara in the 
where the 
 lies. This canopy has been restored by S. M. Burrows, the head of Archeology Department during (1884-1886) and thus the name.
The Sinhalese laborers then informed him that they have a way of moving such items even to greater heights and he explained that by filling the gap between the two columns with earth, any object could be rolled up and positioned at the top. All you have to do after that is to remove the earth.
Mr. Burrows took the idea and said to have completed the restoration of this canopy using this method.
