Muwandeniya Sri Dammaloka Purana Tampita Viharaya
Muwandeniya is a picturesque village hidden between remote hills in Matale district 10 km away from Matale off the Oyapahala Road (Harrison John’s Road).
Muwandeniya Sri Dammaloka Purana Viharaya consists of a Tampita Viharaya built during the Kandyan era. A Tampita Viharaya is a structure built on a wooden platform which rests on number of stone stumps usually 3-4 feet tall. The roof is held by a structure built of timber and the walls are generally made of wattle and daub.
Unfortunately the Tampita Viharaya at the Muwandeniya temple has been completely rebuilt and has lost its architectural and archaeological value.
