The Menik Vehera stupa on built on a high pedestal
Menik Vehera Aramaic complex of the Polonnaruwa Kingdom is believed to be built on the 8th century. There are indications that some additions to this complex have been made at later stages. The original name of the stupa has been lost in time but this is considered the oldest Stupa in this area.
This rather small Stupa is built on an unusually high platform with stone steps leading to the top of it. The platform is surrounded by a brick wall.
The complex has two image houses, one closest to the stupa has three standing buddha images and one in seating position. The other image house smaller in size has only one rock carved buddha statue.
Recent excavations on this complex have discovered a hospital and a large number of buildings where bikkus (priests) resided.
The guard stones at the menik vehera is also unique. Generally on the side of the guard stone you can find a carving of a bull. But on the guard stones at the entrance of the Menik vehera this bull has been replaced by an elephant.
