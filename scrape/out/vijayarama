Vijayarama is an ancient buddhist monastery lying on the outskirts of Anuradhapura close to the ancient stone bridge (Gal Palama). The complex spans 23 acres which has been declared as an archaeological site.
The ruins of Vijayarama was first noted by H.C Bell but no attention was given to these ruins since 1896.  The complex was covered in jungle for over 120 years without any attention until 2014 when the archaeological department initiated a project to study and protect the ruins.
The study has discovered 43 ruins so far in the Vijayarama archaeological reserve and this complex has been identified as a pabbatha viharaya completed with Panchavasa belonging to the Abayagiri Mahayana Buddhists.
The Historical Guide to Anuradhapura’s Ruins by Hubert E. Weerasooriya published in 1939 provides a detailed description of this site
