Badagamuwa Thorayaya Ancient Tampita Viharaya
Badagamuwa Thorayaya Ancient Viharaya is a Buddhist temple with an ancient Tampita Viharaya built during the era of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747 – 1781) of Kandyan Kingdom.  The temple lies bordering Badagamuwa Forest on the Kurunegala – Dambulla road.
A Tampita Viharaya is a structure built on a wooden platform which rests on number of stone stumps usually 3-4 feet tall. The roof is held by a structure built of timber and the walls are generally made of wattle and daub.
The original Tampita Viharaya at the Badagamuwa Thorayaya Temple is built on 8 tall pillars and said have had 3 stories. The enlarged ground floor had been used as the Pohoya Geya. The walls of the image house on the top had been covered in murals. However this tampita viharaya has been now converted to a single floor. The Pohoya Geya which had been built surrounding the Tampita Viharaya is missing as well as the 3rd level.
A narrow circumambulating path protected by a wooden balustrade can be seen surrounding the image house. The outer wall is painted in white and lacks any murals today. The entrance of the image house is guarded by two guardian deities. The entrance is plain and is made in the form of Chandrawanka. There are 4 statues inside the image house. The main Buddha statue is in the seated position the the other standing statues are thought to be of Arhaths.
Empty spaces for 3 more statues can be seen along side the walls. Unfortunately these statues have been stolen by treasure hunters in the past. All the statues have been carved in sandalwood, plastered and painted. Inner wall is retains few murals but most have been faded and destroyed with time. These display Kandyan sittara styles. Some paintings which have probably been done  at a later date can be seen on the ceiling.
To reach the temple travel 5.5 km on the Dambulla road from Kurunegala. Just after passing the Badagamuwa Forest, take first lane to the left which is called Govipola Road. Traveling 200 meters on this road you will find the temple gates to the left.
