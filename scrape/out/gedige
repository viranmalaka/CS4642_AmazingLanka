To the north east of 
, lies a set of ruins which are rarely visited by pilgrims. These ruins are accessible through a by-road on the Watawandana Road or Sangamitta Road.
The ruins lying in this area are the  
 (one of the refectories of 
), A ruin identified as the
 (House of the Tooth Relic), 
, an image house with a semi domical roof) and another image house almost identical to Gedige, simply known as Building “A”. All these 4 buildings lie 50 meters of each other.
The building known as Gedige is a brick structure more or less close to the image house known as building ‘A’. Gedige is considered to have been a sanctuary for those of Mahayana cult who preached Tantric leanings.
Although the history of this structure is not known, the building has been built entirely from bricks and in fact the above two image houses are also the only known image houses built entirely of brick masonry in Anuradhapura. Only the door and window frame has been built with granite.
There is material evidence of the vaulted roof of both buildings and proofs of staircases which led to the upper floors. Both shrines have square outer shrine and projecting bays on each sides and a regular square as the inner sanctum.
Leaving the vestibule out, the images houses are almost identical in size, building ‘A’ is 36×36 feet and Gedige is 34×34 feet. There is also some belief that one or both of these buildings may have been Tooth Relic temples and the building now known as the Temple of Tooth Relic might be part of a palace complex.
