Ruins of the Nai Pena viharaya
This Devala identified as  Vishnu Devala (number 4)  and also known as Naipena Viharaya has been a place of worship for God Vishnu by the Hindus. Unlike other Devalas in the areas this has been built by bricks and today only the stone pillars remain of this building.
A carving which represented a cobra with seven heads has made this site popular as the “Naipena Viharaya”. Naipena simply means head of the cobra. Even though many images of Hindu gods have been found in the site no image of God Vishnu hasn’t been found.
