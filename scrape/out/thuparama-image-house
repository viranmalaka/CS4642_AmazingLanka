Thuparama Image House
The Thuparama Image House at the ancient capital of Polonnaruwa  is one of the few buildings where you can see a roof completely made out of bricks. Almost the whole building has survived over 900 years miraculously. The roof is a semi-cylindrical in shape. The original name of this image house is not known; therefore the builder of this is also unknown. It is thought that this was built by a minister of King Parakramabahu (1153-1186) called Mahinda to house the tooth relic. Another belief is that this was built by king Vijayabahu I (1070-1110).
The walls of this building are about 7 feet (2 meters) thick and inside a large seating Buddha statue has been kept. Nothings remain of this statue today. It is said that the eyes of this Buddha statue was embedded with precious stones and the windows were designed in such a manner the sunlight would reflect on these stones and light the image house.
