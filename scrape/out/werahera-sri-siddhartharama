A sketch of a Tampita Viharaya
Sri Siddhartharama Rajamaha Viharaya is a Buddhist temple with an ancient Tampita Viharaya belonging to the Kandyan era. The temple lies in Werahera off Yakwila between Pannala and Kuliyapitiya. It lies about 6 km from Pannala and 15 km from Kuliyapitiya.
A Tampita Viharaya is a structure built on a wooden platform which rests on number of stone stumps usually 3-4 feet tall. The roof is held by a structure built of timber and the walls are generally made of wattle and daub. Walls inside the chamber is more or less always covered in paintings drawn mainly in Kandyan style.
It is said that during the regin of king Kithsiri Mevan (303-311) an arhath named Siddhartha enshrined a relic casket  and built the  stupa of this temple. The name Werahera is said to be originated from Veherata – Hari, turn off to the Vehera (temple).
To reach the temple from Pannala, the easiest is through Yakwila even though shortcuts through internal roads exists. From the Punnala junction, take the Kuliyapitiya road and ravel 6 km to reach Yakwila. From Yakwila take the Werahera road and travel 2.3 km reach the Sri Vijitharamaya temple. Take the left turn as soon as you pass this temple to reach Sri Siddhartharama Rajamaha Viharaya. This temples lies almost at the rear border of the Vijitharamaya Viharaya.
