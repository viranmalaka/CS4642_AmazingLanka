statue of King Parakramabahu
This beautifully carved statue stands 11½ feet (3.5 meters) in height and carved in to a semi-circular rock. Popular belief is that this is the statue of king Parakramabahu (1153-1186)  thus generally known as the Parakramabahu Statue. . Another belief is that this is a statue of an Indian high priest (probably “Kapila” of “Pulasthi”). The long beard and the mustache, the hair, the clothing, and the body with a slightly large stomach are not what you would expect from a statue of a great king.
Irrespective of who this represent, this is a quite beautiful and unique statue showing the highest level of craftsmanship of the rock carving engineers of that time.
This statue can be reached by traveling about 1 ½ kilometres along the 
 dam. There is a small unidentified and destroyed Chethya closer to this statue. It is believed by some that this is the burial ground of king Parakramabahu and this stupa holds the remains of the king.
