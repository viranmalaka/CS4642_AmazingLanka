Sri Sudharmarama Purana Viharaya is a Buddhist temple with an ancient Tampita Viharaya belonging to the Kandyan era. The temple lies in the Dandagamuwa village just 3.5 km off Kuliyapitiya, 24 km off Narammala and 25 km from Madampe.
A Tampita Viharaya is a structure built on a wooden platform which rests on number of stone stumps usually 3-4 feet tall. The roof is held by a structure built of timber and the walls are generally made of wattle and daub. Walls inside the chamber is more or less always covered in paintings drawn mainly in Kandyan style.
The Tampita Viharaya of the Dandagamuwa Sri Sudharmarama Purana Viharaya is built on 16 granite pillar stumps erected on a raised platform filled with gravel. A wooden stair case is built to reach the wooden platform. A narrow circumambulating path is built around the image house with a wider space at the front. The outer wall of the image house is covered in paintings of Suvisi Vivaranaya.  The roof of the building is thatched with flat clay tiles typical of buildings of Kandyan era. A Hewisi Mandapaya has been built in front of the Tampita Viharaya. The roof of the Hevisi Mandapaya is held by six large granite pillars. The viharaya it self has been restored recently.
